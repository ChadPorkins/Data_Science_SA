  *Suicide attacks are five times more leathal than ordinary attacks.
  *In the last 5 years suicide attacks have became more and more common, and have been used in 40% of all conflicts in comparison to 4% in the 80s.
  *Suicide attacks have became a popular combat tactic among militant groups especially when combating stronger military forces.
  *Due to their shocking nature they amplify militant group’s propaganda efforts.

Literature 1 - Human Capital and the Productivity of Suicide Bombers
Benmelech's and Berrebi's article (2017) provides the first detailed empirical analysis of the relationship
between suicide bombers characteristics and their performance in suicide bombing
attacks, The conclusion was that Palestinian terror organizations match older and
more-educated suicide bombers to more important Israeli targets, another conclusion was that older and more-educated suicide bombers kill more people in their suicide attacks
when assigned to important targets.
Furthermore, older and more-educated suicide bombers are less likely to fail or to be caught when they
attack.
This paper also contributes to the debate on the relation between education, poverty, and terrorism. While suicide bombers are on average more
educated than the general Palestinian population, their estimate of higher
education among suicide bombers is three times lower than the figures reported by Berrebi
(2003) and Krueger and Maleckova (2003).

Literature 2 - What’s Special about Female Suicide Terrorism?
O'Rourke's articale (2009) analyzes the interaction between the motivations of individual attackers and terrorist group strategies.
To do so it combines a quantitative analysis of all known suicide terrorist attacks between 1981 and July 2008 with a strategic account of why terrorist
organizations employ female suicide terrorism and case studies of individual female attackers.
The author advances five main claims:
1)She reveals the superior effectiveness of female suicide terrorism from the perspective of the groups that employ women.
2)She explains that terrorist groups increasingly enlist women as suicide attackers because of their higher effectiveness.
3)She demonstrates that terrorist groups adapt their discourse, catering to the specific individual motives of potential female suicide attackers in order to recruit them.
4)She shows that female attackers are driven by the same general motives and circumstances that drive men.
5)She concludes that, unless target states adapt their defensive strategies, we should expect an increase in female suicide terrorism.
